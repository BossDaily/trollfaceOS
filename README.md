The worst operating system imaginable.

Currently a heavy WIP


Inspired (and heavily based on) by https://github.com/jdah/tetris-os
Also, a huge thanks to OSDev wiki's great documentation on this sort of stuff https://wiki.osdev.org/Main_Page

Compiling:
An i686 gcc cross compiler is needed in order to build this. A great guide on building one can be seen here: https://wiki.osdev.org/GCC_Cross-Compiler

Once the cross compiler is compiled, add it to the system path and run make on the project.
To test, run the img file on QEMU. A windows batch file to run it is included in the project directory for easy testing.

Goals:
The goal of this project is to create the operating system with the worst user experience. Examples include random crashes, file corruption, and annoyances.
